Project Layout
--------------

    - /bin
        Contains binary output from the ROS build process.  Currently this
        project does not produce any binary output to this directory.
    - /build
        Contains cmake build files for the project.
    - /lib
	Contains library files.  The ros build process outputs a library here
	that is used to execute the project in ROS. 
    - /src
	Contains project source files.
    - CMakeLists.txt
	cmake build information. Also defines orocos components of the project.
    - example.launch/example.ops
        Use the roslaunch command on example.launch to run this project in ROS
        (as opposed to using the rosrun command).  The example.launch script
        calls the example.ops orocos script.
    - mainpage.dox
        DOxygen documentation file?
    - Makefile
	It's a makefile...
    - manifest.xml
	ROS manifest file.  Defines project dependencies and other information.
    - README
        This document.


Building
--------

    The hubo_ctrl ROS project depends on the rtt and rtt_rosnode packages.
    You can install the packages using:

        rosdep install hubo_ctrl

    Once dependencies are installed, you can build the hubo_ctrl project using:

        rosmake

    if you are already in the hubo_ctrl directory or:

        rosmake hubo_ctrl

    otherwise.  A successful build will create the libhubo_ctrl-gnulinux.so in
    hubo_ctrl/lib/orocos/gnulinux/


Running
-------

    Ensure a ROS master node is running:

        roscore

    In a different terminal, start the Hubo ROS node:

        roslaunch example.launch

    In yet another terminal, you can interface with the Hubo ROS node.  See the
    ROS tutorials for more information.
